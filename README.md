===========

A Cards Against Humanity IRC bot

This is currently a very poorly written bot, however most of the functionality is complete.

Future versions will focus on making it easier for users to run their own
version, simply by editing a json file containing any options that are required.

Configuration file
------------------

Simply copy the content of the ``irc-sample.json`` file provided and save it as ``irc.json``. Adapt it to your needs. You can provide the following keys:

* host
* port
* channel
* identity
* realname
* hostname
* botname
